A few years ago I was interested in learning XCB, and this project is my
attempt at porting TinyWM to XCB. It works about as well as you could expect
from a Window Manager this simple. I include the original source because in is
well annotated and a great way to learn Xlib programming.

If you are aware of TinyWM, you will know that it is the simplest of all X
Window Managers out there. My XCB port is no different.

Requirements (on Debian):
	* libxcb1-dev
	* libxcb-util0-dev

To build:
	gcc -o tinywm tinywm-xcb.c -lxcb -lxcb-util
